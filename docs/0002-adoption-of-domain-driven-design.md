# ADR-002: Adoption of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-10-05

## Context

`Kontrakt` is a framework that will evolve and expand with new features over time. To ensure this long-term extensibility, the internal architecture must be designed to be easily manageable and adaptable. A core challenge in any growing software is maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities to prevent the codebase from becoming a tangled monolith.

We need a structured approach to ensure our design remains clean, modular, and easy to reason about as it grows in complexity.

## Decision

We will adopt **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** as the guiding methodology for designing the core logic of `Kontrakt`.

The primary reason for this choice is that we believe **DDD is the most effective methodology for achieving a well-structured, object-oriented design**.

Specifically, we are adopting DDD to leverage its patterns for **dividing and grouping responsibilities within clear, minimal boundaries.** This directly supports our main architectural goal: extensibility.

* We will use **Bounded Contexts** to partition the framework's features into distinct, logical domains (e.g., `Test Definition`, `Test Execution`). This prevents features from becoming overly coupled.
* We will use **Aggregates** to group related objects and logic into cohesive units with a single entry point (the Aggregate Root). This makes the system easier to manage and ensures interactions between components are well-defined.

## Consequences

By adopting DDD, we are prioritizing the long-term health and extensibility of the codebase.

* **Improved Extensibility:** When we add a new feature, the Bounded Contexts will guide us on where to place the new logic and how it should interact with existing features, minimizing unintended side effects.
* **Enhanced Maintainability:** The clear boundaries established by Aggregates and Bounded Contexts make the system easier to understand, reason about, and modify. This will simplify future development and bug-fixing efforts.
* **Object-Oriented by Design:** This decision forces us to think in terms of well-defined objects with clear responsibilities from the very beginning, ensuring that the framework itself is a prime example of good object-oriented principles
